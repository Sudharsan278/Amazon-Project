Amazon Clone Project:
 
Overview: -
    The Amazon Clone project aims to replicate the core features of the well-known e-commerce platform, Amazon. This project provides a user-friendly interface for browsing products, managing a shopping cart, and placing orders, offering a comprehensive shopping experience similar to the original site.

Features: - 
 
  - Product Browsing: Users can view a wide range of products, each with detailed information. The product listings are dynamically loaded from the backend.
    
  - Search Functionality: Users can search for products using keywords. The search results are displayed in real-time, allowing for a seamless shopping experience.
    
  - Shopping Cart: Users can add products to their cart, which is dynamically updated. The cart's contents are stored and managed using `localStorage`, ensuring persistence across sessions.
    
  - Order Placement: Users can place orders for the items in their cart. The order data is sent to the backend for processing, and users receive confirmation once the order is successfully placed.

Technology Stack: -

  - Frontend: 
    - JavaScript for dynamic content updates.
    - HTML/CSS for layout and styling.
    - localStorage for cart management.
  
  - Backend: 
    - Spring Boot: Handles product data retrieval, cart management, and order processing.
    - MySQL: Stores product information, user data, and order details.
    - Spring Data JPA: Facilitates interaction with the MySQL database.
    - Lombok: Simplifies code by reducing boilerplate.
    - Spring Web: Manages RESTful endpoints and services.

How It Works: -

  1. Frontend Interaction: The frontend interface allows users to browse products, add items to their cart, and place orders. The product data is dynamically loaded from the backend.
  
  2. Backend Processing: The backend, built with Spring Boot, manages API requests for product information and order processing. It interacts with a MySQL database to store and retrieve data.
  
  3. Data Flow:
     - Product data is fetched from the backend and displayed in the frontend.
     - Users can add products to their cart, which is managed using localStorage.
     - Orders are submitted to the backend, where they are processed and stored in the database.
  
Setup: -

  1. Frontend Setup:
     - Ensure that the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files are correctly set up.
     - Configure dynamic content loading and cart management.
  
  2. Backend Setup:
     - Set up a Spring Boot project in your preferred IDE (e.g., Eclipse).
     - Configure MySQL database and connect it using Spring Data JPA.
     - Add necessary dependencies: Lombok, Spring Data JPA, MySQL Driver, and Spring Web.
  
  3. Running the Project:
     - Start the backend server using Spring Boot.
     - Serve the frontend files through a web server or directly from the filesystem.
     - Access the application through your browser to test and use the features.
